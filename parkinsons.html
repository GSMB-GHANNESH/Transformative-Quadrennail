    Hack: Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.
    If you give yourself 5 hours, a task will take 5 hours. 
    If you give 2 hours, you'll finish in 2 hours.
    How to Use?
    Set artificial deadlines that are shorter than the actual deadline.
    Use a countdown timer or deadline apps to create a sense of urgency.
    Helps avoid procrastination and makes tasks feel more manageable.
